# Data Fetcher - Feature Documentation

**Status**: ✅ Implemented & Production-Ready

The Data Fetcher is a config-driven, step-based system for fetching and processing Pokémon data from multiple sources (PokeAPI, manual enrichments) into the target format required by the PDF generator.

## Features

**✅ Implemented:**
- Complete National Dex fetching (1025 Pokémon, 9 generations)
- Config-driven pipeline with YAML scopes
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting for API stability (0.2s between requests)
- Source/Target data separation
- Translation enrichments (ES/IT with 52 entries each)
- Featured Pokémon enrichment
- Generation-based grouping
- Test scopes for development

**User Stories:**

**US1: Kompletter Pokédex laden**
- Alle Pokémon in einem Befehl laden
- Selten benötigt (Setup + Updates)

**US2: Neue Pokémon nachladen**
- Nur neue Pokémon laden bei neuer Generation
- System erkennt was neu ist

**US3: Einzelne Pokémon aktualisieren**
- Gezieltes Neuladen für Fehlerkorrekturen

**US4: Source und Target trennen**
- Rohdaten (Source) getrennt von finaler Struktur (Target)
- Rohdaten können überschrieben werden
- Target hat Anreicherungen und bleibt stabil

**US5: Manuelle Anpassungen erhalten**
- Nur API-generierte Daten werden aktualisiert

## Canonical reviewed refresh

Release builds never fetch mutable API data. A maintainer refreshes and reviews
the complete snapshot in one ordered path before committing it:

```bash
python scripts/fetcher/fetch.py --scope all
python scripts/data/audit_data_refresh.py --baseline-ref HEAD --output tmp/v10-data-refresh-audit.json
python scripts/data/build_snapshot_manifest.py --boundary 2026-09-12 --output data/snapshot.json
python scripts/release/verify_data_snapshot.py --manifest data/snapshot.json
```

The audit records additions, removals, localized field changes and metadata
changes per file. Duplicate card identities, duplicate printed numbers within a
language, and localized names that were not observed for that card are blocking
errors. Review the complete audit before rebuilding the manifest; do not edit
generated JSON around a failed fetch.

## Architecture: Fetcher Pattern

**Implementation**: Config → Fetcher Steps → Target

**Location**: `scripts/fetcher/`

### Data Sources

The fetcher supports multiple API sources for different data types:

| API | Purpose | Languages | Client | Status |
|-----|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **PokeAPI** | National Pokédex data (species, forms, stats, sprites) | 8 languages (DE, EN, FR, ES, IT, JA, KO, ZH) | `pokeapi_client.py` | ✅ Production |
| **Pokémon TCG API** | TCG cards (EX, GX, V, VMAX, etc.) | English only | `tcg_client.py` | ✅ Ready |
| **TCGdex** | TCG cards (multilingual, complete) | 10+ languages (DE, EN, FR, ES, IT, PT, JA, ZH, ID, TH) | `tcgdex_client.py` | ✅ Ready |

**API Details:**
- **PokeAPI**: Rate limit 100/min, comprehensive Pokémon data, official source
- **Pokémon TCG API**: 20k/day (200k with key), Lucene query syntax, English-focused
- **TCGdex**: ~10M/month, GraphQL support, TCG Pocket integration, multilingual

**Usage Strategy:** 
- Use PokeAPI for National Dex scopes
- Use TCGdex for multilingual TCG card scopes (preferred)
- Use Pokémon TCG API for English-only TCG scopes or specific query needs

```

**Key Principle**: Target structure is fixed (PDF Generator requirement). Fetcher transforms Source → Target, never reverse.

### Optional post-fetch poster phase

The fetcher deliberately stops after producing scope data. For an individual
TCG set, poster configuration, source assets, and local ComfyUI generation are
an explicit optional phase before PDF generation. This keeps normal data fetches
deterministic and avoids starting a GPU workflow implicitly.

Run the read-only planner immediately after a relevant fetch to see whether the
poster is still current and which explicit step, if any, comes next:

```bash
python scripts/poster_assets/poster_work_plan.py --scope SV04
python scripts/poster_assets/poster_work_plan.py --scope Pokedex
```

The planner does not mutate data or start ComfyUI. In particular, localized
text, logo, panel-design, and PDF-routing changes are separated from expensive
scene/figure/model drift.

See [Poster Artwork Workflow](POSTER_WORKFLOW.md) for the one-scope and
all-missing-scope initialization commands, the scene catalog, generation review,
promotion, semantic provenance migration, and optional PDF inclusion.

### Fetcher Steps

**✅ Implemented Steps:**

**fetch_pokeapi_national_dex** - Fetch from PokeAPI
- Fetches species + pokemon data for all National Dex entries
- Supports generation filtering: `generations: [1, 2, 3]`
- Optional limit per generation: `limit: 3` (for testing)
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with 1s, 2s, 3s backoff
- Rate limiting: 0.2s between requests
- Timeout: 10s per request
- Saves to: `data/source/{scope}.json`

**fetch_tcgdex_set** - Fetch TCG Set
- Fetches complete TCG set from TCGdex API (e.g., ME01)
- Retrieves set metadata including logos and release dates
- English card names and localIds
- Saves to: `data/source/{set_id}.json`

**fetch_tcgdex_ex_gen{1,2,3}** - Fetch TCG ex/EX Cards
- ExGen1: Classic ex series (Ruby/Sapphire era, 2003-2006)
- ExGen2: Pokemon-EX from BW & XY series (2012-2016) 
- ExGen3: modern Pokémon ex era (2023-present), including Mega Evolution sets
- Fetches from TCGdex API with set-specific filtering
- Handles Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion variants
- ExGen3 validates the supplied `dexId` against the canonical Pokédex name
  lookup and corrects inconsistent upstream IDs before saving the source cache
- Saves to: `data/source/tcg_{classic,bw,sv}_ex.json`

**transform_ex_gen{1,2,3}** - Transform TCG Cards
- Selects one representative card per configured Pokemon/form grouping
  (priority: first set > alphabetical)
- ExGen3 normal cards are grouped by exact `(species ID, Official Artwork ID)`,
  so named forms of one species remain separate
- Groups Mega variants by (dexId, form_suffix) for X/Y separation
- Extracts form variants (X/Y for Mega, Primal for primals)
- **PokeAPI Artwork Integration**:
  - Always uses PokeAPI official artwork (TCG images include card frames)
  - Base-form Pokemon use the species artwork ID
  - ExGen3 named normal forms use the reviewed mappings in
    `config/pokeapi_form_species.json`
  - Alolan Exeggutor, Black Kyurem, Bloodmoon Ursaluna, and the four Ogerpon
    masks therefore remain separate exact artwork subjects
  - Mega X/Y: Queries PokeAPI for form-specific IDs (10034/10035 for Charizard)
  - Primal forms: Uses `{name}-primal` pattern
  - Poster preparation rejects a named special form without its exact
    allowlisted Official Artwork instead of substituting base artwork
- ExGen3 repeats the canonical Pokédex name check when transforming an existing
  local source cache, so the offline path has the same ID correction
- Saves to: `data/output/ExGen{1,2,3}.json`

**group_by_generation** - Transform to Target Format
- Converts flat Pokemon list to generation-grouped structure
- Matches PDF generator's expected format
- Maps language codes (ja, ko, zh_hans, zh_hant)
- Converts types array to type1/type2 fields
- Adds generation metadata (name, region, range)

**enrich_translations_es_it** - Translation Enrichment
- Loads: `scripts/fetcher/data/enrichments/translations_es.json` (52 entries)
- Loads: `scripts/fetcher/data/enrichments/translations_it.json` (52 entries)
- Overwrites Pokemon names where better translations exist
- Applied before grouping (on source data)

**enrich_featured_elements** - Section Cover and Poster Cast Enrichment
- Works for both Pokedex (generations) and Variants (sections)
- Automatic selection remains available for ordinary scopes
- `section_featured_card_ids` declares an ordered, deterministic cast where
  art direction requires exact cards and forms
- ExGen3 normal uses Koraidon, Pikachu, and Miraidon; ExGen3 Mega uses Mega
  Latias, Mega Diancie, and Mega Lucario
- ExGen2 Mega uses Mewtwo X, Rayquaza, and Latios; Mewtwo Y remains a separate
  card/form without displacing the reviewed cast
- Missing, duplicate, ambiguous, invalid, or unknown-section card IDs are hard
  errors
- Persists a separate `poster_subject` with species ID, exact Official Artwork
  ID, canonical URL, and stable subject key; the TCG card image remains the
  cover image
- Applied after grouping (on target data)

**enrich_names_from_pokedex** - Pokemon Name Enrichment
- Enriches variant Pokemon names from Pokedex data
- Replaces TCG card names with canonical multilingual names
- Preserves form-specific names (e.g., "Charizard X")
- Exact ExGen3 named forms use the reviewed nine-language labels in
  `enrichments/card_form_names.json`; an unknown named form retains its exact
  English source label in every locale instead of collapsing to a base name
- Applied after transformation (on target variant data)

**enrich_section_descriptions** - Section Description Enrichment  
- Adds descriptive text to generation/variant sections
- Loads from enrichments/section_descriptions.json
- Provides context about each Pokemon group (era, features, etc.)
- Applied after grouping (on target data)

**enrich_metadata** - Metadata Enrichment
- Adds metadata like titles, subtitles, colors to variants
- Loads from enrichments/metadata.json
- Supports all 9 languages
- Applied at pipeline start (before other steps)

**enrich_tcg_names_multilingual** - TCG Multilingual Names
- Fetches set data in all 9 languages from TCGdex API
- Enriches card names with translations (name_{lang} fields)
- Extracts set names in all languages
- Much more efficient than individual card fetching
- Applied after fetch_tcgdex_set

**transform_to_sections_format** - TCG Set to Sections
- Converts flat TCG cards array to sections format
- Generates multilingual metadata (title, description, subtitle)
- Embeds set logos with [image] tag in subtitles
- Formats release dates with localized labels
- Applied after transform_tcg_set

**cache_pokemon_images** - Image Caching
- Downloads Pokemon images to local cache
- Stores in scripts/data/pokemon_images_cache/
- Organizes by pokemon_id folders
- Enables offline PDF generation
- Applied as final pipeline step

**📋 Planned Steps** (not yet implemented):
- `fetch_tcg_ex_pokemon` - Pokemon TCG API
- `load_manual_list` - JSON File loader
- `enrich_from_tcg_api` - TCG data enrichment
- `group_by_tcg_set` - TCG set grouping

## Implementation Details

### Core Properties

- **✅ Idempotent**: Multiple executions produce same result
- **✅ Serial**: Steps execute sequentially (simplicity over speed)
- **✅ Consistent**: Source = source of truth, target synchronized
- **✅ Extensible**: New steps/scopes via config files
- **✅ Target-Driven**: PDF Generator defines target structure
- **✅ Resilient**: Retry logic, timeout handling, rate limiting
- **✅ Testable**: Test scopes with limited datasets

### Error Handling

**API Failures:**
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s)
- 10 second timeout per request
- 0.2s rate limiting between requests
- Graceful degradation on persistent failures

**Data Validation:**
- Missing enrichment files: warning + continue
- Malformed source data: error + stop
- Missing required parameters: error + stop

### Performance

**Full National Dex (1025 Pokemon):**
- Fetch time: ~6-8 minutes (with rate limiting)
- Source file size: ~1.2 MB
- Target file size: ~604 KB

**Test Scope (6 Pokemon):**
- Fetch time: ~3 seconds
- Ideal for development/testing

## Future Enhancements

**Planned Features:**
- TCG API integration for card-based collections
- Incremental updates (fetch only new Pokemon)
- Parallel fetching with worker pool
- Progress persistence for resume capability
- Additional enrichment sources

**Potential Scopes:**
- `tcg_ex_gen1` - EX Pokemon from TCG Gen1
- `tcg_ex_gen2` - EX Pokemon from TCG Gen2
- `mega_evolution` - Mega Evolution forms
- `regional_forms` - Regional variants (Alola, Galar, etc.)
